Modeling missing data in distant supervision

Note: this code needs some work to package up and make it easy to run.  I had several requests for the code, so uploaded it here in the current state in case it is useful.

Some notes on running:

requires Scalala.
Download from github and build using "sbt publish-local" first

I think it needs this file which was too large for github:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/eclcoimpv4xt6nq/freebase-datadump-quadruples.tsv.bz2.filtered

Need to increase the java memory limit, I think the easiest way to do this might be by directly editing the sbt script, e.g.:
rittera@thrust:~/$ cat `which sbt`
SBT_OPTS="-Xms512M -Xmx20G -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=256M"
java $SBT_OPTS -jar `dirname $0`/sbt-launch.jar "$@"
