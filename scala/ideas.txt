1. train Phi parameters heuristically
   -First pass - train only using MultiR
   -In cases where the extractor is very confident, predict whether the relatio will be missing from the DB.
   -In cases where we are very confident there is no mention of the relation, predict whether it is observed in the DB.
   
   Details: probably really need to tune phi on held out data (text mentions should pretty much agree with database on training data)
   Details: should only use most confident extractions for tuning phi...

2. Print out highest weighted features (theta) - might give some insight into any issues...

3. Maybe need some parameter regularization...?
   -Could help with the issue of over-predicting "NA"

4. Q: which works better: local search or A* beam search?
